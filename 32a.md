### Find Single Number

*Contributed by Gopi Suresh*.

Given an vector of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. Write a function `singleNumbers(const vector<int> &vec)` that solves this problem in O(n) time complexity.

#### Example

```cpp
int main() {
    int nums[] = {1, 3, 2, 1, 2};
    vector<int> n(nums, nums + sizeof(nums) / sizeof(int));
    cout << singleNumber(n)<< endl;   
}
```
The above code prints out `3`.

#### Solution

For a challenge, think of a way to solve this without using extra memory.

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int singleNumber(const vector<int> &vec) {
    unordered_set<int> s;
    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); i++) {
        if (s.find(vec[i]) != s.end()) {
            s.erase(vec[i]);
        } else {
            s.insert(vec[i]);
        }
    }
    return *s.begin();
}

int main() {
    int nums[] = {1, 3, 2, 1, 2};
    vector<int> n(nums, nums + sizeof(nums) / sizeof(int));
    cout << singleNumber(n);   
}
```

### Recursive binary search on an array
*Contributed by Robert Zalog*

Implement the function provided by the following function header:

`int findNum(int *nums, int n, int num);`,

which returns the index of a given number `num` in a __sorted__ (in ascending order) array `nums` of length `n`. Your function must not use a `for` loop and must utilize a recursive function call. In addition, your algorithm must run in `O(log n)` time complexity. You can assume that the specified value will always be found in the array (e.g., function caller will not ask you to look for 3 in an array that does not contain a 3).

_Hint:_

You might want to use a helper function that takes a `start` and an `end` parameter instead of just `n`.

#### Example

Example function call:

```cpp
int nums[6] = {1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 18};
findNum(nums, 0, 8); // returns 3
```

#### Solution 

```cpp
int findNumHelper(int *, int, int, int);

int findNum(int *nums, int n, int num)
{
	return findNumHelper(nums, 0, n, num);
}

int findNumHelper(int *nums, int start, int end, int num)
{
	int test = start + (end - start) / 2;
	if (nums[test] == num) {
		return test;
	}
	if (nums[test] > num) {
		return findNumHelper(nums, start, test, num);
	}
	if (nums[test] < num) {
		return findNumHelper(nums, test+1, end, num);
	}
}
```

### Counting Leaves

*Contributed by Shaan Mathur*.

Assume you have a struct defined as below:

```cpp
struct Tree {
    int data;
    std::vector<Tree*> children;
};
```

Write a function int countLeaves(Tree* head) that counts the number of leaves in a tree.
HINT: Recursion and Trees tend to go very well together.

#### Example

		      Head
	    N1			 N2
    N3	N4	N5	   N6	N7

This tree has FIVE leaves.

		[nullptr]
		
This "tree" has no leaves.
		

#### Solution

```cpp
#include <vector>

struct Tree {
    int data;
    std::vector<Tree*> children;
};

int countLeaves(Tree* head) {
    /* BASE CASES */

    // head is an empty tree, in case there are no leaves. Thus return 0.
    if (head == nullptr)
        return 0;
    // The node has no children, which is by definition a leaf. Thus return 1.
    if (head->children.size() == 0)
        return 1;

    /* RECURSION */

    // The node has children, so let's count them and return the total count.
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < head->children.size(); i++) {
        count += countLeaves(head->children[i]);
    }

    return count;
}
```

### generateParenthesis

*Contributed by Gabriel Zhou*.

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

#### Example

 For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:
 [
 "((()))",
 "(()())",
 "(())()",
 "()(())",
 "()()()"
 ]

#### Solution

```cpp

vector<string> generateParenthesis(int n) {
    vector<string> res;
    addingpar(res, "", n, 0);
    return res;
}
void addingpar(const vector<string>& v, string str, int n, int m) {
    if (n == 0 && m == 0) {
        v.push_back(str);
        return;
    }
    if (m > 0) { addingpar(v, str+")", n, m-1); }
    if (n > 0) { addingpar(v, str+"(", n-1, m+1); }
}
```

### nodeCount

*Contributed by Katie Luangkote*.

Write nodeCount, a recursive function that counts the number of nodes in a tree rooted at node. This is a general tree, where a node can have a variable number of children.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int val;
  vector<Node *> children;
};

int nodeCount(Node *node) {
  int count = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < node->children.size(); i++)
    count += nodeCount(node->children[i]);
  return count;
}

```

### Recursively Reverse Words

*Contributed by Rahul Salvi*.

For this question, create a function 'printReversed' that takes a single input std::string and prints it out with the words inside reversed. A word is a sequence of characters followed by a space or newline. The input string will be terminated by a newline character. 'printReversed' should not return anything. 'printReversed' may output an extra trailing space. You may create a single helper function that takes an optional int argument. You may use a loop inside each function call to find a word. There will never be consecutive space characters.

#### Example

"this is a string\n" --> "string a is this " (with or without the trailing space)

"abcd\n" --> "abcd " (with or without the trailing space)

#### Solution

Two solutions are provided. They are both very similar except in the way that they call themselves to continue the recursion. To find a word, they iterate by characters until a space is found, appending to a temporary string. At this point, they print and return if a newline is found. Otherwise, the function is called again to find another word. Finally, the words are printed out in reverse similar to a post-order tree traversal. These solutions do print out a trailing space.

The first solution uses a helper function that tracks the index to begin looking for a word and passes it to the next call.
```cpp
void printReversedHelper(std::string str, int index) {
    std::string s = "";
    int i = index;
    while (str[i] != ' ') {
        if (str[i] == '\n') {
            std::cout << s << " ";
            return;
        }
        s += str[i];
        i++;
    }
    printReversedHelper(str, i+1);
    std::cout << s << " ";
}

void printReversed(std::string str) {
    printReversedHelper(str, 0);
}
```

The second solution opts to remove words from the string as it finds them, then passes the shortened string to the next call.
```cpp
void printReversed(std::string str) {
    std::string s = "";
    int i = 0;
    while (str[i] != ' ') {
        if (str[i] == '\n') {
            std::cout << s << " ";
            return;
        }
        s += str[i];
        i++;
    }
    printReversed(str.substr(i+1, str.length()-i));
    std::cout << s << " ";
}

```

### Iterating through Lists
*Contributed by Annika Tsai*.

Given a const list of strings that represent names, write a function that will iterate through the list and print out all names that contain the letter a.

#### Example

given a const list of names:
`const list<string> names = {"George", "Ryan", "Elise", "Tom", "Hank"}`, the output of the function should contain "Ryan" and "Hank". #### Solution Remember that if you pass a container as a const reference parameter, you have to use a const_iterator as opposed to a regular iterator.
 ```cpp
void print_names(const list &names) {
    list::const_iterator it;
    for (it = names.begin(); it!= names.end(); it++) {
        string name = *it;
        for (int i = 0; i < name.length(); i++) {
            if (name[i] == 'a') cout << *it << endl;
        }
    }
}
```

### Multiplying Two Integers Using EXCITING RECURSION

*Contributed by Frank Fu*.

Write a function called multiply that takes two intergers, x and y, as its arguments and returns the resulting integer product. You MUST use recursion to implement your multiply function, and you are not allowed to use any loops or the multiplication/division operators * and / in your code. Also, be sure to write a main function that prompts the user to enter the two numbers x and y before calling the multiply function in the main function to produce the product. You can assume that the user will not enter anything other than integers as inputs, but be sure to account for special cases such as when x or y is 0 or when either of them is negative.

#### Example

Example 1:
Please enter the number x: -2
Please enter the number y: -2
The product of x and y is: 4

Example 2:
Please enter the number x: 0
Please enter the number y: -1
The product of x and y is: 0

Example 3:
Please enter the number x: -2
Please enter the number y: 5
The product of x and y is: -10

Example 4:
Please enter the number x: 9
Please enter the number y: 4
The product of x and y is: 36

#### Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream> 

using namespace std;

int multiply(int x, int y) {
    // 0  multiplied with anything should return 0
    if (x == 0 || y == 0)
        return 0;

    // Add x with itself with a y number of times
    // Recursively calling multiply(x, y-1)
    if (y > 0)
        return (x + multiply(x, y - 1));

    // If y is negative, we want to return the negative of the result
    if (y < 0)
        return -multiply(x, -y);
}

int main() {
  int x, y, z;
  cout << "Please enter the number x: ";
  cin >> x;
  cout << "Please enter the number y: ";
  cin >> y;
  z = multiply(x, y);
  cout << "The product of x and y is: " << z << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

### Breadth-First Traversal of Binary Tree

*Contributed by Jason Yee*.

Suppose the following structure represented a node in a binary tree: `struct Node {
    int value;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};` Write a function, printTree, that accepts a pointer to a Node and prints the contents of the tree in a breadth-first order, with each value on its own line, assuming that the passed Node is the root of the tree.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int value;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};

void printTree(Node* root) {
    /*The cleanest way to write this code is to use a recursive algorithm; this is
    the methodology demonstrated in this example of a solution.
    If you'd like to practice a non-recursive approach, you will need to use make
    good use of an arbitrary data structure to hold Node* values; you may wish
    to dynamically allocate and reallocate memory for an array, or use one of the
    C++ STL's various containers.*/
    
    if (root != nullptr) { /*Shouldn't do anything if there is no Node to handle*/
        /*The basis of the breadth-first traversal is to first handle the data
        held by the current node, then perform the same process for each Node's
        children.*/
        
        /*First, print the current node's value:*/
        std::cout << root->value << endl;
        
        /*Now repeat the process described above for each of the children.
        Each child is the root of a subtree that can be processed through
        a breadth-first transversal.
        This is why a recursive algorithm is suitable.
        Don't worry about passing nullptr to printTree in the case where a
        child does not exist; the check we did at the start of this function
        fixes that.*/
        printTree(root->left);
        printTree(root->right);
    }
}
```

### Finding the duplicate value in an array

*Contributed by Ryan Lo*.

Given a random array of strings with only 1 duplicate, write a function called "getDup()" to return the duplicate string in O(n) time. If no duplicates, return the string "-1". The function takes the string array and the size of the array as inputs

#### Example: 

If given an array:

```cpp
    string s[] = {"go", "bruins", "defeat", "the", "USC", "trojans", "we", "beat", "USC"};

     then getDup(s, 9) should return "USC" as the duplicate string 
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#include <string>
#include <cassert>
#include <unordered_map>

string getDup(string s[], int n) {
    unordered_map<string, bool> map;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) {
        if (map[s[i]] == true) return s[i];
        map[s[i]] = true;
    }
    return "-1";
}

int main() {
    /*Given a random array of strings with only 1 duplicate, write a function to return the duplicate string in O(n) time. If no duplicates, return the string "-1". The function takes the string array and the size of the array as inputs
    */
    string s[] = {"go", "bruins", "defeat", "the", "USC", "trojans", "we", "beat", "USC"};
    string dup = getDup(s, 9);
    assert(dup == "USC");
    cout << "All cases worked" << endl;
}

### Car Dealership

*Contributed by John Stucky*.

Suppose you have a car dealership that has a collection of cars. Each car has a make, model, unique car ID number, and price. Describe one or more data structures that can do the following:

(a) Given a car manufacturer/make (e.g., Toyota), generate a collection of unique models made by that manufacturer present at the dealership.

(b) Given a car's unique ID number, find the next most expensive car (so the dealer can upsell a customer).

Then use these data structures to implement a `CarDealership` class that is constructed from a collection of cars and can perform the operations listed above. The code for `Car` and a prototype for `CarDealership` have been provided.

```
struct Car{

    int id;
    string make;
    string model;
    double price;
    explicit Car(int i = -1, string m = "", string n = "", double p = -1.0) {
        id = i;
        make = m;
        model = n;
        price = p;
    }
    bool operator<(const Car& rhs) const;
};

bool Car::operator<(const Car& rhs) const {
  return price < rhs.price;
}

class CarDealership{
 public:
    explicit CarDealership(const vector<Car>& cars);  // to be implemented
    vector<string> car_models(string manufacturer);  // to be implemented
    Car upsell(int id);  // to be implemented
 private:
    // to be implemented
};
```

#### Example

A small `CarDealership` has 7 cars:
| ID  | Make | Model | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Toyota | Camry   | 20000 |
| 2   | Toyota | Prius   | 28000 |
| 3   | Toyota | 4Runner | 36000 |
| 4   | Ford   | Focus   | 18000 |
| 5   | Ford   | F150    | 27000 |
| 6   | Toyota | Camry   | 19000 |
| 7   | Ford   | F150    | 26150 |

A call to `car_models("Toyota")` should return a vector of size 3 with strings `"Camry", "Prius", "4Runner"` in any order.
A call to `upsell(5)` should return a car with id, make, model, and price of `2, Toyota, Prius, 28000`, respectively.

#### Solution

One sensible way to efficiently compute the list of models given a manufacturer is to use a hash table, or an unordered map, from each make to its associated models, where the models are an unordered set. Explicitly, this is an `unordered_map<string, unordered_set<string>>`.

To quickly find a car given its ID, one can use an unordered map from IDs to Cars: `unordered_map<int, Car>`. Then once one has a Car object, one can find the next most expensive car by using an ordered set, sorted by price: `set<Car>`.


```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>
#include <unordered_set>

        id = i;
        make = m;
        model = n;
        price = p;
    }
    bool operator<(const Car& rhs) const;
};

bool Car::operator<(const Car& rhs) const {
  return price < rhs.price;
}

### Maximum Height of a Binary Tree

*Contributed by Stephanie Lam*.

Given the following struct for a node of a binary tree, write the getHeight function, which determines the maximum height of the tree. The maximum height is defined as the maximum number of nodes in the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. The parameter passed into the getHeight function is the node of the tree. 

```cpp
struct Node {
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
}

int getHeight(Node* n) {
    // complete function 
}

#### Solution

The solution can be found using recursion. We get the height of the left subtree and the height of the right subtree, and then take the maximum value of the two, adding 1 for the root node. 

```cpp
int getHeight(Node* n) { 
    if (n == nullptr) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        int left_height = getHeight(n->left);
        int right_height = getHeight(n->right);
        // return the max height between the left and right subtrees 
        if (left_height < right_height) 
            return right_height + 1;
        else
            return left_height + 1;
    }
}
```

### Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it

*Contributed by Yiyin Jin*.

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

#### Solution

We go through each node one by one and record each node's reference (or memory address) in a hash table. If the current node is null, we have reached the end of the list and it must not be cyclic. If current node’s reference is in the hash table, then return true.

```cpp
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
  Set<ListNode> nodesSeen = new HashSet<>();
  while (head != null) {
    if (nodesSeen.contains(head)) {
      return true;
    } else {
      nodesSeen.add(head);
    }
    head = head.next;
  }
  return false;
}

```

### Index of Non Repeated Character

*Contributed by Jason Wong*.

Write a function to determine the index of the first non-repeated character in a string. If
no non-repeated characters exist, return -1. The string we pass in will consist of only
characters a-z; that is, only lower cased letters. Strive for efficiency.
After you are done, analyze the time and space complexity of your function. Can you do better?

Function skeleton below:
```
int firstUniqueCharacter(string s) {
}
```

#### Examples

Input: abbccdd
Output: 0, because a is non-repeated, and is at index 0

Input: aabbcdefg
Output: 4, because c is the first non-repeated character in the string

Input: aabbccddeee
Output: -1, because there are no non-repeated characters

#### Solution

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

/*
Analysis:
The time complexity of my function is O(s), where s is the length of the string
We loop through 26 characters, then loop through our string twice. Look up in 
my int array is O(1). We have O(26 + s + s), which is O(s)
My function uses O(1) space; I only use an int array, of size 26.
*/
int firstUniqueCharacter(string s) {
    // We do not need a BST or Hash table. We know that there are 26 lower cased letters
    int map[26];
    for (int i = 0 ; i < 26; i ++) {
        map[i] = 0;
    }

    // Each entry int the array indicates the count of eah character    
    for (int i = 0 ; i < s.size() ; i++) {
        int index = s[i] - 'a';
        map[index]++;
    }
    
    for (int i =  0 ; i < s.size() ; i++) {
        int index = s[i] - 'a';
        // If we only saw the character once, this is the first non-repeated character
        if (map[index] == 1) {
            return i;

### Length of Largest Increasing Subsequence

*Contributed by Jung Hyun Park*.

Given a vector set of numbers, write a program that would find the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the vector.
#### Example

    vector<int> v{ 1, 4, 2, 9, 12, 7, 6 };
    cout << "Length is: " << coolFunc(v);
    Try it out friends!

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int bSearch(const vector<int> &v, int l, int r, int key) {
    while (r-l > 1) {
    int m = l + (r-l)/2;
    if (v[m] >= key)
        r = m;
    else
        l = m;
    }
    return r;
}

int coolFunc(const vector<int> &v) {
    if (v.size() == 0)
        return 0;

    vector<int> temp(v.size(), 0);
    int length = 1;  // length of longest subsequence
    temp[0] = v[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < v.size(); i++) {
        if (v[i] < temp[0])
            temp[0] = v[i];  // change smallest value
        else if (v[i] > temp[length-1])
            temp[length++] = v[i];  // add term to subsequence
        else
            temp[bSearch(temp, -1, length-1, v[i])] = v[i];
    }
    return length;
}

### Are two strings anagrams?
*Contributed by Justin Hong*.

Write a function to determine whether two strings are anagrams. You may use the std::sort function after including <algorithm>.
#### Solution
Two strings are anagrams if they have the same number of same letters. Therefore strings that are anagrams must be identical after they are both sorted.
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
bool isAnagram(string first, string second) {
    if (first.size() != second.size()) return false;
    sort(first.begin(), first.end());
    sort(second.begin(), second.end());
    if (first == second) return true;
    return false;
}
```

### Queue of Two Stacks

*Contributed by William Shao*.

Implement a FIFO (first in first out) queue<int> class. The only member variables you
can use are two std::stack<int>s. Implement the class using the following skeleton:

```
#include <stack>
class StackQueue{
    private:
        std::stack<int> stackOne;
        std::stack<int> stackTwo;
    public:
        void push(int x) { //Push an int into the queue

        }
        
        void pop(){ //Remove the oldest int in the queue
        
        }

        int front() { //Return the oldest value queue (Don't remove it)

        }
}
```

#### Solution

Imagine putting the stacks head to tail. We push to the top of one stack and when we want to pop,
we "pour" the contents of the first stack into the second, so now the oldest values are on top 
and newest on bottom.

```cpp
#include <stack>
class StackQueue {
 private:
        std::stack<int> stackOne;
        std::stack<int> stackTwo;
        
 public:
        void push(int x) {  // Push an int into the queue
            stackOne.push(x);
        }

        void pop() {  // Remove the oldest int in the queue
            if (stackOne.empty() && stackTwo.empty()) {
                return;
            }
            
            if (stackTwo.empty()) {
                while (!stackOne.empty()) {
                    stackTwo.push(stackOne.top());
                    stackOne.pop();
                }
            }
            stackTwo.pop();
        }

        int front() {  // Return the oldest value queue (Don't remove it)
            if (stackTwo.empty()) {
                while (!stackOne.empty()) {
                    stackTwo.push(stackOne.top());
                    stackOne.pop();
                }
            }
            return stackTwo.top();
        }
}
```
